Regression test for routine ipxetas.  Reads an input file
of vegetation greenness on a 'filled' 12km eta grid.  Then
calls ipxetas to:   

 1) create a staggered mass grid from the full grid.
 2) create a staggered velocity grid from the full grid.
 3) create a full grid from the staggered mass grid created by step (1)
 4) create a full grid from the staggered vel grid created by step (2)

Output from the control and test programs is written to binary files.
(Steps 1 and 2 written to "staggered.bin", and steps 3 and 4 written
to "full.bin").  These files may be viewed in Grads
with the ".ctl" files, located in the ./grads subdirectory.

The fortran source code is located in the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled by invoking the makeall.ksh script
located in the ./scripts subdirectory.  See the script
comments for more information before compiling.  The executables reside
in the ./exec/ctl and ./exec/test subdirectories.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the runall.ksh script in the ./scripts subdirectory.

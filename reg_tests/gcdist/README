Test iplib routines gcdist and movect, which calculate the
distance of great circle routes and their corresponding
rotation parameters.

The Fortran source code and make-related files are 
located in the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the ./reg_tests directory.  See the script
comments for more information.  Program executables are
stored in the ./exec subdirectory.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the runall.ksh script in the ./scripts subdirectory.

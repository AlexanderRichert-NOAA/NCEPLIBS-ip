Invoke copygb to interpolate a global lat/lon grid of vegetation
greenness to numerous ncep standard grids.  Use all interpolation
options: 0-bilinear, 1-bicubic, 2-neighbor, 3-budget, 4-spectral,
6-neighbor-budget.

The ncep standard grid numbers are defined in the official
ncep grib documentation.
 
The input data is: /nwprod/fix/global_shdmax.0.144x0.144.grb

The Fortran source code and make-related files are 
located in the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled by invoking the make_reg_test.ksh script
located in the ./reg_tests directory.  See the script
comments for more information before compiling.  The executables
are stored in the ./exec subdirectory.

The regression test is run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the proper driver script in the ./scripts subdirectory as follows:

"llsubmit run_ccs.ksh" (ccs machine)
"bsub < run_wcoss.ksh" (wcoss machine)
"qsub run_zeus.ksh" (zeus machine)

These driver scripts call the copygb.ksh script.

This is considered a 'supplemental' regression test and it is not
run as part of the full suite of tests from the "Runall"
driver in the ./reg_tests directory.

Note, the copygb executable in this directory is used as part of
the ipxwafs2_3 regression test.

Regression test for ncep copygb program.

Invoke copygb to interpolate a global lat/lon grid of vegetation
greenness or albedo to numerous ncep standard grids.  Use all interpolation
options: 0-bilinear, 1-bicubic, 2-neighbor, 3-budget, 4-spectral,
6-neighbor-budget.

The ncep standard grid numbers are defined in the official
ncep grib 1 documentation. Not all standard grids are tested.
For example, grids 90, 91 and 92 are very high-res, which
will cause copygb to run very slow, especially for the spectral
interpolation.  
 
The input greenness data is: $NWPROD/global_shdmax.0.144x0.144.grb
The input albedo data is: $NWPROD/global_snoalb.1x1.grb
The lower res albedo data is only used for the spectral interpolation
(which is computationally intensive).  On WCOSS, NWPROD=/nwprod/fix 
(located on phase 1/2). On Theia, NWPROD is the following gfs subversion tag:
/scratch4/NCEPDEV/global/save/glopara/svn/gfs/tags/gfs.v13.0.2/para/fix/fix_am

The copygb source code and make-related files are 
located in the ./sorc subdirectory.

The program is compiled with all byte versions of the 'control' and 'test' 
iplibs by invoking the make_reg_test.ksh script located
in the /reg_tests directory.  See the /reg_tests/README
file for more information before compiling.  

The three byte versions of the library are:
  > 4 byte integer/4 byte float
  > 8 byte integer/8 byte float
  > 8 byte float/4 byte integer

The executables (a total of six) are stored in the 
./exec subdirectory.

The regression test is run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the proper driver script in the ./scripts subdirectory as follows:

"cat run.wcoss.lsf | bsub"      (wcoss phase 1/2 machine)
"cat run.wcoss-cray.lsf | bsub" (wcoss-cray machine)
"cat run.wcoss-dell.lsf | bsub" (wcoss-phase 3 - Dell  machine)
"qsub run.theia.ksh"            (theia machine)

These driver scripts call the copygb.ksh script located in ./scripts.

The interpolated greenness or albedo is output in grib 1 format.
If the grib 1 files from the 'control' and 'test' iplibs is
not bit identical, the regression test is considered failed.

This is considered a 'supplemental' regression test and it is NOT
run as part of the full suite of tests from the Runall.${machine}.ksh
driver in the ./reg_tests directory.

NOTE, the copygb executable in this directory is used as part of
the ipxwafs2_3 regression test.

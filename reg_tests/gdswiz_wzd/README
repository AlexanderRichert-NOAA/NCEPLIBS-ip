Test gdswiz and gdswzd and all of their child routines
to calculate lat/lon and other map-related fields for several
grids of various map projections.

The following grids are tested:

grid #       description
======       ===========
003          one-degree global lat/lon (ncep grid 3)
008          mercator (ncep grid 8)
127          t254 gaussian (ncep grid 127)
201          rotated lat/lon e-staggered (number refers to gds octet 6)
             tests routines gdswizc9 and gdswzdc9
202          rotated lat/lon b-staggered (number refers to gds octet 6)
             tests routines gdswizca and gdswzdca
203          rotated lat/lon e-staggered (number refers to gds octet 6)
             tests routines gdswizcb and gdswzdcb
205          rotated lat/lon b-staggered (number refers to gds octet 6)
             tests routines gdswizcd and gdswzdcd
212          nh polar stereographic, spherical earth (number meaningless)
213          sh polar stereographic, spherical earth (number meaningless)
218          lambert conformal (ncep grid 218)
222          nh polar stereographic, elliptical earth (number meaningless)

The routines are called twice to test both the 1) i/j to lat/lon
and 2) lat/lon to i/j conversions.  This operation should be reversable.
If it is not reversable within floating point differences, a warning
message is printed to standard output.

The latitude, longitude and all other computed map fields (such as 
grid box area and rotation factors) are output to a binary file.
These files may be visualized in grads using the control files in the
./grads subdirectory.  The binary files from a 'control' and 'test'
are compared in the runall.ksh script.  If bit identical, the test
'passes'.

The fortran source code is located in the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled by invoking the makeall.ksh script
located in the ./scripts subdirectory.  See the script
comments for more information.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the runall.ksh script in the ./scripts subdirectory.

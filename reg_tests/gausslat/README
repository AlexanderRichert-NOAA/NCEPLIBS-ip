Regression test for routine gausslat.  Routine is called 
from a simple Fortran program to calculate the gaussian
latitudes for a t382 grid.  

The Fortran source code and make-related files are
located in the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the ./reg_tests directory.  See the script 
comments for more information.  The executables are stored
in the ./exec subdirectory.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the runall.ksh script in the ./scripts subdirectory.

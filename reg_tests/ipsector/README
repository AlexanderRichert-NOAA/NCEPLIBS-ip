Test iplib routines ipsector, which creates a subset of a 
larger two-dimensional field, and routine ipspaste, which
does the opposite.

More specifically, read in a global lat/lon grid of
soil substrate temperature (with bitmap).  Call routine
ipsector to 'chop out' north america.  Write the
subsectored data to a binary file.  Then do the inverse:
call routine ipspaste to 'paste' north america back into the
global grid.  Write the merged data to another binary file.
The binary files may be viewed in Grads using the ".ctl"
files in the ./grads subdirectory.

The input file of global substrate temperature is located 
in the ./data subdirectory.

The fortran source code is located in the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled by invoking the makeall.ksh script
located in the ./scripts subdirectory.  See the script
comments for more information.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the runall.ksh script in the ./scripts subdirectory.

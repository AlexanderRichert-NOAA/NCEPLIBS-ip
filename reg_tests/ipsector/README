Test iplib routines ipsector, which creates a subset of a 
larger two-dimensional field, and routine ipspaste, which
does the opposite.

More specifically, read in a global lat/lon grid of
soil substrate temperature (with bitmap).  Call routine
ipsector to subset north america.  Write the
subsectored data to a binary file.  Then do the inverse:
call routine ipspaste to 'paste' north america back into the
original global grid.  Write the merged data to another binary file.
The data output from ipspaste should match the original data.
The binary files may be viewed in Grads using the ".ctl"
files in the ./grads subdirectory.

The routines have differing logic for different Grib 1 scan
modes.  So there are two input files of global substrate
temperature - one for scan mode '0' and one for scan mode '32'.
Both datasets are located in the ./data subdirectory.

The fortran source code is located in the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled by invoking the makeall.ksh script
located in the ./scripts subdirectory.  See the script
comments for more information.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the runall.ksh script in the ./scripts subdirectory.

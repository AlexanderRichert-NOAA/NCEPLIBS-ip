Regression test for iplib routine makgds.

Routine is tested as follows:
  1) create gds and kgds arrays for ncep grid 3.  arrays hold grid
     description information used by w3 grib library.
  2) make kgds array for grid 3 from gds array
  3) make gds array for grid 3 from kgds array

The Fortran source code and make-related files are located 
in the ./src subdirectory.

The program is compiled by invoking the make_reg_tests.ksh script
located in the ./reg_tests directory.  See the script
comments for more information.  The executables are stored in 
the ./exec subdirectory.

The regression test may be run 'stand-alone' by invoking
the runall.ksh script in the ./scripts subdirectory.

   and the include files will be placed in ./include
 - On Dell:
    - Load the Intel compiler module.
    - Invoke the build script as follows:
      $ ./build_ip.sh dell libver="ip_v3.0.2"
    - Move libraries and include files to final location.
 - On Cray:
    - Load the Intel compiler module.
    - Invoke the build script as follows:
      $ ./build_ip.sh cray libver="ip_v3.0.2"
    - Move libraries and include files to final location.
    - Load the Cray compiler module.
    - Invoke the build script as follows:
      $ ./build_ip.sh cray_comp libver="ip_v3.0.2"
    - Move libraries and include files to final location.
